# Simple Ransomware Simulator (EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This application is designed **SOLELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES** to demonstrate how ransomware operates. It is intended for cybersecurity education, awareness training, and understanding the technical aspects of encryption-based threats.

**By using this simulator, you agree to:**
1. Use it ONLY on test files in a controlled environment
2. NEVER use this knowledge or code for malicious purposes
3. Take full responsibility for any consequences of using this tool

**Misuse of this knowledge is illegal and unethical.**

## Overview

This simulator demonstrates the basic principles of how ransomware works:
1. Encrypting files using strong encryption (Fernet symmetric encryption)
2. Creating a ransom note
3. Providing a decryption mechanism when the correct key is supplied

## Features

- **Educational GUI Interface**: Clear, user-friendly interface with explicit warnings
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Simulates the encryption and decryption process
- **Test File Generator**: Creates harmless test files to demonstrate the encryption
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bar and status updates during the process
- **Ransom Note**: Generates a simulated ransom note for educational purposes
- **Key Management**: Demonstrates the importance of encryption keys

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- Cryptography module (`pip install cryptography`)

## How to Use
